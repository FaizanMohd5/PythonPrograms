1) WAP to create a dictionary with integers as keys and their squares as values.

Code:

d1 = {i:i**2 for i in range(1,int(input("Enter range:"))+1)}
print(d1)


2) Sort a dictionary by it's keys in descencding order

Code:
d2 = {2:"b",1:"a",3:"c",4:"d"}
d2 = dict(sorted(d2.items(),reverse=True))
print(d2)

3) WAP create a dictionary with key values as cricket player names and data values are tuple
of 4 elements - maches played
              - total runs
              - half centuries
              - centuries
All data should be user input

Code:
resultant = {}
player_names = [key for key in input("Enter names(sep=' '): ").split(' ')]
print("Enter details of each player(sep=' ')")
tuple_list = []
for i in range(len(player_names)):
    tuple_list = [i for i in input("Enter mathes-player, total-runs, half and full centuries(sep=' '): ").split(' ')]
    resultant[player_names[i]] = tuple(tuple_list)
print(resultant)

4) Write a python script to find the maximum size batch code from a dictionary where key-values
in the dictionary are batch codes and data-values are size of the batch.

Code:
import random 
batch_sizes = {"BC"+str(random.randrange(561,600)+i):random.randrange(50,100) for i in range(10)}
print(batch_sizes)

maximum = max(list(batch_sizes.values()))

for key, val in batch_sizes.items():
    if batch_sizes[key]==maximum:
        print("\nMaximum size batch code:",batch_sizes[key])
        break

5) WAP to create a dict object from a list of city names in such a way the alphabets are keys of 
the dictionary and list of city names starting from that alphabet will be its data value

Code:

list_cities = ['Hyderabad','Mumbai','Secundrabad','Hi-tech city','Old city','Merat','Lucknow']
d5 = {}
for i in list_cities:
  if i[0] not in d5.keys():
    d5[i[0]] = [i]
  else:
    d5[i[0]].append(i) if i not in d5[i[0]] else None
print(d5)
