1) WAP to print all distinct elements of a list. Use set to solve the problem.

Code:

print(list(set(int(i) for i in input("Enter numbers(Space separated)").split(' '))))


2) Create two sets from a given set of numbers to seperate even and odd numbers.

Code:

set_numbers = {3,4,6,3,7,4,5,8,0,3,1,5,7,5,8,9}

set_odd, set_even = set(), set()

{set_odd.add(i) if i%2==0 else set_even.add(i) for i in set_numbers}
    
print(set_odd,set_even,sep='\n')


3) Given a set of five player names. Write a python script to form all possible
pairs of players that is selecting two players at a time.

Code:

4) You have list of names of candidates, some of them are wearing black hat
   some of them are wearing red shoes and some of them are wearing both. 
   Now you have given a list of names of candidates wearing black hat.
   There is another list of names of candidates wearing red shoes. 
   Write a python script to find out thenames of the candidates wearing
   black hat and red shoes.

Code:

red_shoes = ['Mr A','Mr G','Mr C','Mr E']

black_hats = ['Mr A','Mr C','Mr F','Mr E','Mr G',]

red_shoes_black_hats = set(set(red_shoes).intersection(black_hats))

red_shoes_black_hats

5) create a set of tuples, where each tuple has two elements representing dice
 upper face number. Take a number N from the user and generate all possible 
 tuples, in such a way that tuple elements sums to N

Code:

set_tuples = set()

n = int(input("Enter the number of tuples:"))
